1. Use your PL to write a program that asks the user to enter an integer between 1 and 10. Continue to prompt the user as long as the value entered does not fall within this range. When the entry is valid, display "Congratulations!" the same number of times as the value of the input.
2. Page 458 describes how to calculate McCabe's cyclomatic complexity metric by counting decision points in a routine. Use it to count the decision points in the program you wrote for the previous item, and enter the count below.

    Cyclomatic complexity for my "Congratulations!" program = 4
