# Using conditionals

1. Write a simple program in your PL that prompts the user to enter a numeric grade, and store the grade in a variable named `score`. Use `if`/`else` structures (not `case` or `switch`) to test the value of `score` and print the associated letter grade. Use a ten point scale (an A is >= 90). Valid values are from 0 to 100; include tests to print an error message for invalid values. Be prepared to explain how your code follows the guidance in section 15.1.
2. Write a small program to show that your PL does or does not do short circuit evaluation of Boolean expressions. You may use the code example given in the reading commentary as a guide.
3. A PL can also short circuit on Boolean expressions of the form A OR B. Draw up the "shortcut" truth table for OR, below. 

| A     | B                            | A OR B |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
|       | doesn't matter, don't bother |         |
|       |                              |         |
|       |                              |         |
