# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.
```"any string of letters, digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit" ~Programming in Lua 3rd edition```

## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?
```any work, the book uses camelCase most of the time though```

## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 
```they are reserved words that it does not allow as an identifier, but Lua is case sensitive so and and AND are not the same and can be used```
### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
