# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.


## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?


## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 
### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
