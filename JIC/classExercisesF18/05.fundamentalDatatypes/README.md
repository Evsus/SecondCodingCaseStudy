# Fundamental Datatypes

Using your PL, write programs to match the behavior of the following sample sessions. Whenever appropriate, apply the programming techniques covered in the course readings.

When you have finished, commit to your working branch and create a pull request (PR).

## Exercise 1

Use appropriate variables to perform integer calculations that produce the output shown below.
```
Enter your age in years: 46
You are ...
16790 days old, or
402960 hours old, or
24177600 minutes old, or
1450656000 seconds old.
```

You should:

- avoid "magic numbers" by using named constants, or the closest thing provided by your PL (see p. 292)
- anticipate integer overflow (see p. 293) At this point, you may not know how to write code in your PL to prevent this, but test your program with an input of 88 years 

## Exercise 2

Use appropriate variables to perform real number calculations that produce the output shown below.
```
Enter the number of quality points earned: 710
Enter the number of credit hours earned:  253
The grade point average is 2.8063241106719365
```

You should:

- anticipate divide-by-zero issues (see p. 292). At this point, you may not know how to write code in your PL to prevent this. However, test your PL's behavior by entering zero credit hours.
