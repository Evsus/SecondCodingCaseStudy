# Sequential Instructions

Your first formal programming assignment can be completed using only sequential instructions (no conditionals, loops, etc.)

There are four programs described in this folder. Select **one** of the four to complete for this assignment. Your work will be evaluated using this rubric.

## Software construction rubric

### F

- [ ] The program fails to cite information sources used, falsifies data, or is otherwise dishonest.
- [ ] The program's style (indenting, nesting, spacing, blocks, idioms, etc.) causes serious problems for the reader.
- [ ] There is little or no evidence of the program's correctness.

### D

- [ ] The program's style (indenting, nesting, spacing, blocks, idioms, etc.) frequently distracts the reader.
- [ ] There is evidence of the program's correctness, but only for nominal execution scenarios and typical data values.
- [ ] There is no evidence that static analysis tools were used to identify and address potential coding issues.
- [ ] The program contains comments, variables, expressions, statements, functions, etc. that are redundant or unnecessary.

### C

- [ ] The program's style (indenting, nesting, spacing, blocks, idioms, etc.) sometimes distracts the reader.
- [ ] There is evidence of the program's correctness for alternate execution scenarios, and for atypical/invalid data values, but not for all logic branches and boundary conditions.
- [ ] There is evidence that static analysis tools were used to identify and appropriately address some potential coding issues, but not all.
- [ ] The scope of some program identifiers could be more restricted.
- [ ] The use of identifiers misses important opportunities for precise communication with the reader.
- [ ] The choice of data types misses important opportunities for precise communication with the reader.
- [ ] The choice of control structures misses important opportunities for precise communication with the reader.

### B

- [ ] There is evidence of the program's correctness that reflects thorough analysis of logic branches and data boundary conditions.
- [ ] There is evidence that static analysis tools were thoughtfully used to identify and appropriately address all potential coding issues.
- [ ] The scope of all program identifiers is as restricted as possible.
- [ ] The use of identifiers leads to precise communication with the reader.
- [ ] The choice of data types leads to precise communication with the reader.
- [ ] The choice of control structures leads to precise communication with the reader.
- [ ] Some preconditions, postconditions, and/or invariants are documented with appropriate comments and/or assertions; others are not.

### A

- [ ] The program's style (indenting, nesting, spacing, blocks, idioms, etc.) is consistently helpful to the reader.
- [ ] Evidence of program correctness can be automatically regenerated after the program is modified.
- [ ] Evidence of static analysis results can be automatically regenerated after the program is modified.
- [ ] Preconditions, postconditions, and invariants are thoroughly documented with appropriate comments and/or assertions.
